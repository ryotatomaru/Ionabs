This is xspec local model to measure ion column density from absorption lines. 
This code can fit the absorption lines of H-, He-, and Li-like ions via  the Voigt profile. 
If you use it, please read Ionbs_note.pdf.

When you use this model, it would be great to cite the paper "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.4970T/abstract".
